# CoffeeSimula
A 2D/3D Physics engine for Rendering simulation Enviroments.

# About the Journey

This Physics engine tries to bring together Relativistic effects in well-known modern physics. 
Whilst, I am not a brilliant programmer nor physicist myself. My enjoyment for this passion-project
has fueled long nights of Exploring the ins and outs of Physics and programming side-by-side.

Version X-1 is built mainly on Java and Python.
